## Task desciption:
In this bachelor thesis, it will be examined how to improve the gameplay and user experience of FPS games in the field of scenery design.

Firstly, an analysis of already existing FPS games and their scenery design will be accomplished. Information about how users react to certain sceneries will be collected. Two specific FPS games as representative for this genre will be chosen and a deeper research on them will be taken. Corresponding feedback from the first examination will be taken into account. Abstracting the key points and a detailed explanation of them will be given.

Then, a specific prototype model will be created by Unity3D to simulate the stage that the players possibly meet. Many elements can be changed in this model and the feedback from testers will be recorded. The method "control variable" will be implemented.

Finally, the results will be analyzed and a conclusion will be made.
